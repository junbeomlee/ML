1102 quantitatively and qualitatively and show successful real-time face tracking on a number of image sequences containing varying degrees of occlusions. 1 Introduction Active Appearance Models (AAMs)  (and the closely related concepts of Active Blobs  and Morphable Models ) are generative parametric models commonly used to track faces in video. AAMs are normally constructed by applying
1102 collection of training images of faces with a mesh of canonical feature points (usually handmarked) on them . AAMs are then fit frame-by-frame to input videos to track the face through the video . The best fit model parameters are then used in whatever the chosen application is. A variety of video applications are possible, including dynamic pose estimation for real-time user interfaces,
1102 2.1.2 Computing the Shape Variation: si In traditional AAMs the shape vectors si are computed by first aligning every training shape vector s with the base mesh s0 using a similarity transform . The mean shape (i.e. the base mesh s0) is subtracted from each shape vector. Principal Components Analysis  is then performed on the aligned shape vectors s. In the case of occlusion only the
1102 of the face region occluded. Only non-occluded vertices are used in the AAM construction. si are then set to be the orthonormalized eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalues. As is common practice  we retain enough shape modes to explain 95% of the observed variation in the training set. 2.2 Appearance As a convenient abuse of terminology, let s0 also denote the pixels x = (x, y) T that lie
1102 AAMs the appearance vectors Ai are computed by warping all of the input images onto the base mesh using the piecewise affine warps defined between the training shape vector s and the base mesh s0 . Principal Components Analysis is then applied to the resulting images. In the case of occlusion the shape normalized input images are incomplete. If any of the vertices of a triangle are not
1102 algorithm accurately tracks the face while the project-out algorithm fails. portant to note that we achieve accurate tracking of a face across wide pose changes with a single model. In  the same task was achieved using multiple AAMs and a heuristic for switching between them. One major advantage of using only a single model is that the model parameters have the same �meaning� for
